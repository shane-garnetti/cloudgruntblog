![Personal Best Walleye](/walleyepb.jpg)

 My name is Shane Garnetti and I am a former Army Infantry grunt who found a passion for the tech space (hence the name of this blog). I was active duty for 3 years and was in the National Guard for another 3 years. Since I hung up my boots from the army in 2017, I have changed my mission pursuing the tech field where I seek to continuously learn and grow.

Professionally, I am passionate about new technologies and all things AWS. Specifically, security concepts, serverless architecture, netowrking, and machine learning.

Personally, I am a family man first. I am a blessed father of 3 and married to the most amazing woman (I'm spoiled). My wife and kids bring me the most joy! I am very invloved with my church as a Deacon and play the drums there (well I try to...). I am also an outdoor enthusiast! I am always trying to fish when I can. In Washington State we are fortunate to have beautiful lakes and I love chasing BIG Walleye and Muskie! 

Thank you for stopping by!
